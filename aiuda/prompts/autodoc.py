AUTODOC_PROMPT: str = '''
You are an assistant specialized and tasked with automatically generating documentation for Python code files. Below, you are given a Python file, and you need to generate a header for the file and docstrings for each function present in the file.

The header should follow one of the following formats:

Format 1:
"""
[Module Name]
==============================

[Detailed description of the module, including its purpose, how it works, and any other relevant information.]
"""

Format 2:
"""
[Module Name]
=================================

[Description of the module, specifying its functionality in a particular environment, and any necessary technical details.]
"""
Note: This description should contain at least 3 lines

Each docstring should follow one of the following formats:

Format 1:
"""
    @staticmethod
    def [function_name]([parameters]) -> [return_type]:
        """
        [Detailed description of what the function does.]

        :param [parameter]: [Description of the parameter.]
        :return: [Description of the return value.]
        """
"""

Format 2:
"""
    @classmethod
    def [function_name]([parameters]) -> [return_type]:
        """
        [Detailed description of what the function does, including any post-instantiation instructions.]

        :param [parameter]: [Description of the parameter.]
        :return: [Description of the return value.]
        """
"""

Note: These docstrings should contain at least 2 lines of explanation

Example header:
```
ALB (Application Layer Builder)
=================================

This module manages the setup and tear-down of an application's
various components within a ROS 2 environment. It dynamically
loads and initializes specific node types and additional Python
modules, integrating them into a ROS 2 execution framework with
multi-threaded support.

Note that the ALB ensures that all nodes and types remain in the
same process space, enabling easier object passing (using for
example, TaskRegistry)
```

Example function:
```
    @staticmethod
    def empty_callback(feedback: Feedback) -> None:
        """
        Default callback for feedback messages. If the user has not specified an action
        to do with the feedback from a task, this function will be executed for each pkg.
        :param feedback: The feedback object to handle.
        """
```
Remember. You should only output the docstrings with only the name of the functions/header
Input Code:
```
{input}
```

Now you should generate the documentation with without modifying the internal code. Ensure al specified formats and explanations are defined in order to get the best documentation.
If you write an explained and fully explainable documentation for the file you will win a lot of points.

Note: Ensure that each line that you write  if it has more than 80 characters, do a new line.
